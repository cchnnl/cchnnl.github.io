import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I live in Guri, a small city right near Seoul, South Korea.

I didn't belong in this field from the beginning (I have a M.A. in German literature, indeed), but I've always had no hesitation to <Underlining>learn new things and solve problems</Underlining>. So it wasn't difficult to decide to start at the bottom. And this attitude and mentality helps me keep coding quite a lot.

So I am a self-taught web developer and have luckily finished up a couple of projects which have solid views and servers. You can check them out below.

I like challenging new languages, technics, places and people.

I'm looking for a job as <Underlining>a junior frontend developer</Underlining>.
